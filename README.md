# Project-2-Proposal
# Stock Market Web App
# API TO BE USED https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/aapl/chart/dynamic

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION! 
This project would be all about manipulating data given to me by an API request and then sending out other requests by user inputted information from GUI inputs. 

## POTENTIAL PROBLEMS!!!
One major problem would be learning how to manipulate the data so that it automatically renders graphs from the API's information since I am definitely not going to go over 5 years worth of information for countless companies and then hardcode a graph into my DOM.
