# Stock Market Web App
# API TO BE USED https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/${symbol}/chart/dynamic

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION! 
This project would be all about manipulating data given to me by an API request and then sending out other requests by user inputted information from GUI inputs. 

## POTENTIAL PROBLEMS!!!
+ One major problem would be learning how to manipulate the data so that it automatically renders graphs from the API's information since I am definitely not going to go over 5 years worth of information for countless companies and then hardcode a graph into my DOM. 
+ I would also have to learn how to fill in API urls with user input that isn't text. I would like for them to just press an image and then they see their companies stock graph. 
+ I would also like to make the graph interactive. I would like for them to click at a certain point in the graph and then they see the information for that time period.

#POTENTIAL FIXES!!!
+ For the graph I could just take the lowest value of the stock for that time frame and then I could set that as the beginning of the graph and then the same for the highest
